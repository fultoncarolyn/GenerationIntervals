# GenerationIntervals
Simulations for reconstructing generation interval distributions from secondary infection data

## Individual Infectiousness Profiles
Profiles are simulated for the following cases:
- Exponential (multisim.R)
- Delta
- Fixed Stepwise
- Variable Stepwise

## Simulation of Contact Regime
sims.R independently runs a forward contact regime to utilize towards generation interval derivation. 
Content of this code is similar to that of each profile, but is older and represents the exponential case.
